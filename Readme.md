# PULSE DAG MONITOR

Hello Reader !

Thanks for checking out Pulse DAG Monitor.
I named it that way as PULSE - LIVE [Health check]
This project is a simple and practical tool I built to monitor the health of systems that are connected like a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

The idea was to make something that‚Äôs easy to set up, easy to understand, and gives a clear view of how different parts of a system are doing ‚Äî both as a table and a graph you can actually see.

The health checks run asynchronously for better performance, and the results are made simple to read even if you‚Äôre not digging into the backend details. I wanted it to be lightweight but still effective enough for real-world use cases.

I‚Äôve put a lot of thought into making sure it‚Äôs beginner-friendly ‚Äî even if you don't have Python installed yet, you‚Äôll find step-by-step instructions here to get it up and running without any trouble.
Really enjoyed working on this and bringing the idea to life ‚Äî hope you like it too!
Thank you for reviewing my submission. I truly enjoyed building this solution!

## ‚ú® What This Does

- Accepts system information (components + their health check URLs + dependencies).
- Checks each component's health via real HTTP calls.
- Handles unreachable services gracefully.
- Draws a clear, beautiful system graph.
- Presents the results in a clean HTML page (health table + graph).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **FastAPI** (for building the web server)
- **aiohttp** (to make async HTTP requests)
- **NetworkX** (to model the system as a graph)
- **Matplotlib** (to generate the system diagram)

## üöÄ How to Run This Project

Even if you don't have Python installed yet ‚Äî no worries!  
Just follow these steps:

### 1. Install Python (if you don‚Äôt have it)

Go here üëâ [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Python 3.10+.

*(Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation!)*

---

### 2. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

---

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

This is optional but recommended.

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate the environment:
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 4. Install the Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 5. Start the Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

---

### 6. Open Postman to hit the endpoint using a POST Method

Once the server is running, open:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/check_health`
```

Pass the sample Json in the Body and Headers as JSON

## Sample Input (JSON)

Here's a ready-to-go sample:

```json
{
  "components": [
    { "name": "A", "health_check_url": "https://www.google.com" },
    { "name": "B", "health_check_url": "http://localhost:1234/fake" },
    { "name": "C", "health_check_url": "https://thisurldoesnotexist.fake" },
    { "name": "D", "health_check_url": "https://httpstat.us/200" },
    { "name": "E", "health_check_url": "http://localhost:8888/fake" }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    { "from": "A", "to": "B" },
    { "from": "A", "to": "C" },
    { "from": "B", "to": "D" },
    { "from": "C", "to": "D" },
    { "from": "D", "to": "E" }
  ]
}
```

## Assumptions and Design Decisions

### Assumptions

- Every **component** has a **unique name**.
- If a health check URL returns **HTTP 200**, it is considered **Healthy**.
- Any other HTTP status = **Unhealthy**.
- If the URL is unreachable (timeout, DNS error, etc.) = **Unreachable**.
- The system forms a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** ‚Äî no loops/cycles.
- Health checking starts from **root nodes** (no incoming edges).

---

### Why Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- As Intended in the ask for assessment 
- BFS ensures that we check components **layer by layer**.
- It respects dependencies ‚Äî a child component is checked **after** its parent services.
- It's simple and predictable ‚Äî easy to debug and scale.

---

### How the System Graph is Created

- Built using **NetworkX**.
- Visual layout uses `spring_layout` for clean node spacing.
- Graph is generated as a **base64 inline image** and embedded in the HTML response.

---

###  HTTP Call Handling

- All HTTP calls are made using **aiohttp** (async for speed).
- If a service times out or cannot be resolved, it is safely marked **Unreachable**.
- No retries/backoff were added (kept intentionally simple).


##  Final Note

This project was designed to be simple, smart, and close to real-world systems.  
Instead of blindly pinging everything, it understands and respects **system dependencies** ‚Äî just like we expect in production environments.

Hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it!
